# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in cysr.

## Ground rules

- **Before large PRs, open an issue first** — the project has strong conventions
  (deterministic gates, fail-closed guards, Korean-first docs) and we want to
  align direction before you invest time.
- Match the existing style of the file you touch (comment density, naming, 한국어 주석 유지).
- Every changed line should be traceable to the issue/PR intent (surgical diffs).

## Checks that must pass

```bash
cargo test --bin cysd            # daemon unit tests
cargo check -p cys-app           # desktop app
bash ui/build.sh                 # UI bundle
bash scripts/secret-scan.sh --all  # secret/PII gate (fail-closed)
sh scripts/version-check.sh      # version SOT consistency (release PRs only)
```

When upgrading `wry` in `Cargo.lock` (currently 0.55.1), rerun `ui/e2e/dragdrop_gate.py` to verify macOS/Linux drop coordinates still use logical px.

## Directive edits

- **`cysjavis-pack/directives/CEO_TEMPLATE.md` is a generated file — never edit it
  by hand.** It is synthesized from the non-shipped fragment
  `scripts/ceo_template_header.md` + a separator + the byte-identical
  `MASTER_DIRECTIVE.md` body. Whenever you edit the MASTER body (or the fragment),
  you **must** re-run `python3 scripts/gen_ceo_template.py` — otherwise the drift
  gate `python3 scripts/gen_ceo_template.py --check` goes red (exit 1) in CI.
- Never write the guarded lifecycle verbs
  (`launch`|`allocate`|`create`|`down`|`down-sock`|`rotate`|`reap`|`promote-ceo`)
  in **call form** — i.e. `cys-dept <verb>`, backticked or not — inside directives.
  The single-owner guard rejects those calls from the CEO (exit 7), so a directive
  instructing them would contradict its own enforcement; both the H-DOC-3 health
  specimen and `gen_ceo_template.py --check` fail on it. Prose mentions of a bare
  verb (`launch`) are fine — just don't prefix it with `cys-dept `.
  The one exception is `cys-dept create --team-token <token>` (MASTER §4-A-2): the
  guard judges that exact form by the daemon-verified conversational-approval token
  instead of the role, so both checkers exempt it **only while** the guard code still
  has the `[ "$cmd" = "create" ] && [ "${2:-}" = "--team-token" ]` branch. A bare
  `cys-dept create` stays red.
- After resynthesis, run the part-cap pin locally:
  `cargo test --bin cysd deployed_ceo` (CEO synthesized payload must fit the
  delivery part cap with 4x headroom). A unit is one **unique non-empty line** of
  the composed text, so joining a wrapped bullet into one line frees units. Measured
  2026-09-23 (0.14.42 branch, after the §4-A-2 edit): 998 of 1000 units — any net
  new line in MASTER or the CEO fragment must be offset, or the cap/headroom
  changed with a reviewed decision.

## Test isolation — pack sandbox (W0)

Tests must never touch the live pack at `~/.cys/pack`. `cargo test`/`cargo run`
that exercise pack install/update code would otherwise write to the live pack and
can corrupt it. Three structural seals enforce this — you normally do nothing:

- **`.cargo/config.toml [env]`** injects `CYS_PACK_DIR=target/test-pack-sandbox`
  into every `cargo test`/`cargo run`, so even a bare `cargo test` writes to a
  repo-local sandbox, not `~/.cys/pack`. Set your own `CYS_PACK_DIR=$(mktemp -d)`
  to override it per run (honored — `force = false`).
- **fail-closed `pack_dir()`** — in test builds, if no `CYS_PACK_DIR` (or legacy
  `JAVIS_/AITERM_`) is set, `pack_dir()` panics instead of falling back to the live
  path. Tests that manipulate these env vars must use the `EnvGuard` RAII helper
  (restores the previous value on drop, incl. on panic) rather than bare
  `set_var`/`remove_var`, so no "env-is-empty" window is left for a sibling test.
- **positive write authorization** — pack write paths hard-refuse (`Err`) to write
  the live default path unless given a `PackWriteAuth` token, granted only by the
  production entry points (`cysr init-pack`, pack-update/downgrade, cysd boot).

Release binaries are unaffected: the sandbox env only exists under cargo, so a
shipped `cys` still resolves `~/.cys/pack` normally.

## E2E isolation — HOME sandbox (W0-E2E)

The W0 seals cover `cargo test`/`cargo run` only. A **built binary** run by an
E2E is a production entry point, and one write surface ignores the pack env
isolation entirely: `cysr init-pack` registers the awakening hooks into every
personal profile `$HOME/.claude*/settings.json` discovered via
`dirs::home_dir()` (`run_init_pack` → `discover_claude_settings` →
`pack::personal_profile_settings_paths`), even when `CYS_PACK_DIR`,
`CYS_CONFIG_DIR` and `CYS_PACK_CAPTURES_DIR` all point into a scratch dir —
those vars isolate the pack/config/captures paths, not the hook-registration
target. The daemon-side merge (`merge_awakening_hooks_into_personal_profiles`)
skips non-default pack dirs; the CLI target-discovery loop has no such gate yet.

Measured incident (2026-08-31): verification-round E2Es that isolated all three
vars but not `HOME` accumulated 3 pairs of dead SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit
hooks (session-scratchpad and `/var/folders/…` pack paths) in each of the
user's four live `~/.claude*/settings.json`, so every live session start and
prompt attempted to run missing scripts until the entries were pruned
(`cysr hooks-prune --pack-dir <scratch>/pack --allow-base`).

Therefore, for any E2E that executes a built `cys` (`init-pack`,
pack-update/downgrade, boot):

- **Sandbox `HOME` too** — `HOME=$(mktemp -d)` in the E2E env, in addition to
  the pack vars above. This is mandatory, not optional hygiene.
- Belt and suspenders when invoking `init-pack` directly: pass
  `--no-install-hook` (suppresses hook registration at every tier) or an
  explicit `--claude-settings <path-in-sandbox>`; `CYS_NO_PERSONAL_HOOK_MERGE=1`
  additionally disarms the daemon-path personal-profile merge.
- Post-run check: `grep -l '<scratch path>' ~/.claude*/settings.json` must
  match nothing before the E2E counts as clean.

Root fix is ticketed for 0.14.30 (`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_0.14.29.md`, limits
section): port the daemon path's base-location gate to the CLI hook-target
discovery so a scratch-pack `init-pack` never touches personal profiles even
without a HOME sandbox.
